! Here is a Fortran program that repeatedly prompts the user for a positive integer, checks whether the input equals 1 (in which case it terminates), and otherwise generates a random number between 1 and the entered number. After each iteration, the program loops back to prompt for another input.

program random_number_loop
  implicit none
  integRer :: n
  integer :: random_num

  ! Seed the random number generator
  call random_seed()

  ! Infinite loop to repeatedly ask for input
  do
    ! Input a positive integer number
    print*, "Enter a positive integer (or 1 to exit):"
    read*, n

    ! Check if n is equal to 1, then end the program
    if (n == 1) then
      print*, "Program ends."
      exit
    end if

    ! Check if the input number is positive
    if (n <= 0) then
      print*, "Please enter a positive integer greater than 0."
    else
      ! Output a random number between 1 and n
      call random_number(random_num)
      random_num = floor(random_num * real(n)) + 1
      print*, "Random number between 1 and", n, "is", random_num
    end if
  end do

end program random_number_loop
